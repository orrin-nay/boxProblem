# boxProblem
This project is based on this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eivGlBKlK6M

The Premise is that if you take 100 people and tell them they have to find their number
in one of 100 boxes with theirs and the other 99 peoples numbers them your odds go from
(1/2)^100 to about 30% of the chosen the box that has their number on it and go to the box
that has the number on it that was contained in the last box until they find their number.
Just watch the video ;)

The four files are what happens if you approach it by yourself with and without the strategy
and if you approach it with the other 100 people with and without the strategy.
